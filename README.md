1. Select a folder containing files to search.
2. Select a filter (for e.g. *.txt)
3. Enter one or more search terms into the search panel to the left.
4. You may optionally enter a term into the synonym/antonym field and select `Add synonym/antonym` 
which will append to the search panel.
5. Click on the `Search` button on the tool bar.
This will search all files in the target directory matching the specified filter 
for any of the terms in the search panel and display the results in a tree view.
Selecting a node in the tree view will highlight the match corresponding to that node.

Right-clicking a node in the tree view displays a context menu that can be used to copy the
node text or to open the matched file in the registered editor.
